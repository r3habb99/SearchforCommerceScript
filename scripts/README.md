## Scripts Overview

### Conversion Scripts (`scripts/conversion/`)

#### `convert_with_options.js`
Interactive conversion script that provides different optimization levels during conversion.

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run convert:options
```

**Features:**
- Interactive menu for optimization levels
- Real-time configuration updates
- Integrated with main universal converter

### Optimization Scripts (`scripts/optimization/`)

#### `optimize_output.js`
Post-processing optimization utility for reducing file sizes while maintaining data integrity.

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run optimize              # Interactive mode
npm run optimize:minimal      # 88% size reduction
npm run optimize:balanced     # 60% size reduction (recommended)
npm run optimize:compact      # 83% size reduction
npm run optimize:all          # Generate all versions
```

**Optimization Levels:**
- **Minimal**: Essential fields only, basic search functionality
- **Balanced**: Good balance of size and functionality (recommended for production)
- **Compact**: Moderate reduction with full functionality
- **Compressed**: Gzip compression for maximum space savings

#### `show_results.js`
Displays comparison table of original vs optimized files with recommendations.

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run results
```

**Features:**
- File size comparisons
- Reduction percentages
- Production recommendations
- Next steps guidance

## Integration with Main Project

All scripts are properly integrated with the main `universal_converter.js` in the root directory:

- Scripts reference the main converter using relative paths (`../../universal_converter.js`)
- Output directories remain in the root (`./output/`, `./optimized/`)
- Package.json scripts updated to reference new locations
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing workflows

## File Paths

The scripts use the following directory structure:
- **Input**: `./output/` (generated by main converter)
- **Optimized Output**: `./optimized/` (created automatically)
- **Logs**: `./logs/` (error and processing logs)
- **Data**: `./Data/` (source JSON files)
